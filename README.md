# Responsive-Portfolio
Link to page : https://ckzard.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/

**A clean and straight-forward webpage for an aspiring developer to give insight into who they are, with a page to display projects they made and finally a contact page for potential employers.**

**The page is responsive and will adjust depending on screen size, the navigation bar links are functional and will reduce to a button with drop down functionality for smaller screens.**

**The portfolio page currently contains placeholder images, that can be replaced by screenshots of actual projects and turned into a link that will take you to the project itself.**

**The contact page currently has limited functionality, thus information submitted goes nowhere. However it can be updated to have the form submitted and information emailed.**
